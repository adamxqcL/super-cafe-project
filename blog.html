      <h2>5 THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT COLD BREW COFFEE</h2>
      <p class="with_left_border">
        Cold brew concentrate is cold brew with a very high coffee to water ratio. The drip coffee you're used to is anywhere from 1 part coffee to 16 to 20 parts water. We also call this "strength". Cold brew concentrate is often 1:4 to 1:8. It is literally a concentrated coffee drink and is much stronger - and has much more caffeine - than the same amount of drip coffee liquid. 
      </p>
      <p>
       Cold brewing – or in many cases ambient temperature brewing – uses time in place of temperature to ensure extraction. Cold brewing can take between 8 and 24 hours, depending on who you ask and what your target cold brew taste is.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cold brew coffee is also often made as a concentrate which is then diluted - or "watered down" - to taste from there. So, while pour-over coffee and most drip coffees have a brewing ratio of about 1 to 16 coffee to water (ex: 20 grams of ground coffee brewed with 320 mL of water), cold brewing is usually done with less and with a wide range of possibilities to suit different tastes.

      <h2>5 EASY MODS TO KEEP YOUR FAVORITE MEALS FRESH</h2>
      <p class="with_left_border">
Vegetarians and meat eaters alike love our breakfast and lunch menus, but there’s no reason to feel limited to one category when browsing for a snack, or feel like you have to put your favorite meal on repeat every visit.

 We recommend adding a side of our candied bacon and a side of hot sauce vinaigrette to the toast to let the acidity of the vinaigrette cut against the creamy avocado and savory bacon fats. The combination results in an intense experience, as the contrast seems to multiply the already amazing flavors found on the avocado toast.

        When we added Impossible Sausage to our vegetarian options, we opened up a world of possibility for our vegetarian guests. For an extra protein pop, on top of the already healthy helping of black beans, you can add an Impossible Sausage to your black bean burrito. The well-seasoned “meat” brings an added layer of savory to an already scrumptious lunch favorite.
